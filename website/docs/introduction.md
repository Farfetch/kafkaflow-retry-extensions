# Introduction to KafkaFlow Retry Extensions

üîÅ KafkaFlow Retry is an extension to [KafkaFlow](https://github.com/Farfetch/kafkaflow) that implements resilience on Apache Kafka consumers.

Get started by installing [KafkaFlow Retry Extensions](getting-started/installation) or following our [Quickstart](getting-started/quickstart).

## Features {#features}

Our goal is to simplify building resilient Apache Kafka consumers when using KafkaFlow. 

To do that, KafkaFlow Retry Extensions gives you access to retry policies like:
 - Simple Retry
 - Forever Retry
 - Durable Retry

**Durable Retries** let you keep processing while keeping the faulty message offset persisted on **SqlServer** or **MongoDb**.You can also expose an HTTP API to manage those messages.
